        <h4>RADHA DAMODAR TEMPLE</h4>
        <p>This is one of the most important of the ‘Seven Goswami Temples’ and was established by Srila Jiva Goswami,
          who was both the nephew and the disciple of Srila Rupa Goswami.</p>
        <p>The original deity of Radha Damodara was personally hand carved by Rupa Goswami and given to Jiva as a gift.
          This deity is now being worshiped in jaipur, where all the deities of the Gaudiya Goswamis were taken for
          safety due to the fear they would be desecrated by Aurangzeb’s soldiers.</p>
        <p>The replica deity known as the pratibhu-murti, which has exactly the same potency as the original, is
          presently being worshiped here at the Radha Damodara Mandira. (Ref VMP) The contemporary Gosvāmīs and devotees
          assembled here for iṣṭagoṣṭhīs and, in those gatherings of Vaiṣṇavas, Śrī Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa would elucidate on
          Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam in his melodious voice. Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī compiled Śrī Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,
          Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi and other sacred texts on bhakti at this place.(Ref VMP). Between the two buildings and just
          next to the parikrama path is a well that represents the one commissioned by Rupa Gosvami and used to serve
          Radha-Damodara until Srila Prabhupada’s time.(Ref NVM)</p>

        <h4>RADHA GOKULANANDA TEMPLE</h4>
        <p>The temple of Radha Gokulananda is one of the ‘Seven Goswami Temples’ of Vrindavana and was established by
          Lokanatha Goswami.
          This temple was established by Lokanatha Goswami, who in the later years of his life performed bhajan at this
          place. Although he was not one of the Six Goswamis, he was one of the renowned Gaudiya Goswamis and his temple
          is included amongst the famous ‘Seven Goswami Temples’. Lokanatha is often referred to as being the ‘Seventh
          Goswami’ of Vrindavana.</p>
        <p>Although the temple he founded was known as Radha Gokulananda, he himself worshiped the deity named Shri Shri
          Radha Vinoda, which he discovered in Kishori-kunda at Umraya.</p>

        <h4>RADHA GOPINATH TEMPLE</h4>
        <p>This temple is on the banks of Radhakunda near Mother Jahnav’s sitting place. These Radha-Gopinatha deities
          were installed after jahnava-devi had received darshan of Gopinatha standing under a tamal tree on the bank of
          Radha-Kunda.</p>
        <p>The deity of Lord Gopinatha was originally established by Vajranabha Maharaja at Vamsi Vata five thousand
          years earlier. Then during the period of the Six Goswamis the deity of Lord Gopinatha was rediscovered at
          Vamsi Vata lying buried in the ground near the famous banyan tree. Madhu Pandita Goswami came to Vrindavana
          and was searching everywhere for the deity of Lord Gopinatha.</p>
        <p>Not finding the deity anywhere, and feeling great sorrow, Madhu Pandita gave up eating food and sat at Vamsi
          Vata while shedding a constant stream of tears. As it was the monsoon season there was a great flood in
          Vrindavana and the River Yamuna overflowed her banks. The force of the flood waters apparently swept away the
          old banyan tree that stood at Vamsi Vata and when the flood waters receded, the deity was seen halfburied in
          the ground by Madhu Pandita’s close friend and companion named Paramananda Bhattacharya, just beneath where
          the old banyan tree had once stood.</p>
        <p>Paramananda immediately called his friend Madhu Pandita who retrieved the deity. The deity was then moved to
          the spot where the present Gopinatha temple now stands.</p>

        <h4>RADHA SHYAMSUNDAR TEMPLE</h4>
        <p>The temple of Radha Shyamasundara is one of the ‘Seven Goswami Temples’ of Vrindavana and was established by
          Shyamananda Pandita Goswami during the course of his second visit to Vrindavana.</p>
        <p>AAlthough he was not one of the Six Go swamis of Vrindavana, he is counted amongst the famous Gaudiya
          Goswamis who were important followers of Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Like Radha Damodar, the exterior of Radha
          Shyamsundar Temple is very modest. The courtyard is a bit larger than Radha Damodar’s, and instead of three
          arches, the altar nija-nikata-nivasam dehi govardhana tvam 61 has five. Tulasi grows in the courtyard and the
          samadhi of Shyamananda Prabhu is nearby.</p>
        <p>Most of his disciples were from Jagannatha Puri, Orissa, evident by the plaques in Oriyan script bearing the
          names of temple donors.(Ref VD) Çré Baladeva Vidyäbhushan up on establishing Gaudiya Vaishnavism as a
          sampradaya in its own right was awarded the stewardship of Radha-Syamasundara’s temple, a service that he
          performed up to his last breath.</p>

        <h4>RADHA RAMAN TEMPLE</h4>
        <p><strong>Significance of worshiping Shalagrama-shila:</strong>This is one of the ‘Seven Goswarni Temples’ and
          was established by Gopala Bhatta Goswami, one of the famous Six Goswamis of Vrindavana. The deity of
          Radharamana suddenly self-manifested one day from a shalagrama-shila just for the pleasure of Gopala Bhatta.
          All shalagrama-shilas are considered to be a natural manifestation of Lord Vishnu and are therefore
          immediately worshipable and do not need to be installed.</p>

        <p><strong>Temple construction:</strong>Radha Ramana is only a short walk, on route to Kesi Ghat. We enter the
          temple compound through an archway leading in from the street. The new temple building for Radha Ramana was
          completed in 1826 by Shah Kundan Lal, the same architect who built Shahji Temple.</p>
        <p><strong>Temple Architecture:</strong>Two-story buildings enclose the first courtyard, shutting out direct
          sunlight. We enter a second courtyard and behold the Radha Ramana Temple wedged in between a couple of
          buildings. The facade is built of light brown sandstone, and the main archway is decorated with spiraling
          lotus designs.</p>

        <h4>RADHA GOVINDADEVA TEMPLE</h4>
        <p>Sri-Sri Radha Govinda at Yoga-pitha are the main Deities of the Gaudiya Vaisnava Sampradaya, because they
          accept the devotee’s service and inspire ever-increasing surrender and loving devotion. Yoga-pitha means the
          meeting place or the place where a devotee can connect with Krishna and His eternal associates. The means of
          connection is surrendered devotional service for the pleasure of Lord Govinda, as most perfectly exemplified
          in the selfless actions of Srimati Radharani and the gopis.
          While reading the following description of the beauty of Radha-Govinda’s Yoga-pitha, one should not forget the
          goal of completely dedicating himself to the loving service of the lotus feet of Sri Guru, Sri Gauranga and
          Sri-Sri Radha-Govinda. Actually, the Yoga-pitha means service; for the service attitude permeates everything
          there. The ground, the trees, the flowers, the vines, the fruits, the deer, the birds, the jewel-cottages, the
          wind, the Yamuna, the manjaris, the gopis and Sri Radhika everything and everyone within the Yoga-pitha exists
          only for the service and pleasure of Sri Govinda.</p>
